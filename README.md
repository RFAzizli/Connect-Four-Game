Basically, all you need to know, is that your goal is to connect 4 checkers of color. You can connect them diagonally, vertically or horizontaly.
However, your opponent might do that too, so don't let him get to his goal.

When you choose a column to insert your checker to, the checker will drop to the last vacant row. Try to create a pattern that always wins, a trap pattern or whatever you wish, just win the game, please.
# How to run the game

To run this game all you need to create a test class and add the following lines:
